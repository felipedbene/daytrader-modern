                <p>The DayTrader performance benchmark sample provides a suite of workloads for characterizing performance of
                    Java EE Application Servers. The workloads consist of an end-to-end web application and a full set of primitives.
                    The applications are a collection of Java classes, Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Enterprise Java Beans
                    built to open Java EE APIs. Together these provide versatile and portable test cases designed to measure
                    aspects of scalability and performance.</p>

                <p>DayTrader is an end-to-end benchmark and performance sample application. It provides a real world Java EE workload.</p>
                <p>DayTrader's design spans Java EE 7, including the new WebSockets specification. Other Java EE features include
                    JSPs, Servlets, EJBs, JPA, JDBC, JSF, JMS, MDBs, and transactions (synchronous and asynchronous/2-phase commit).</p>

                <h3>Primitives</h3>
                <p>The <a href="web_prmtv.html">Primitives</a> provide a set of workloads to individually test various components
                    of an Application Server. The primitives leverage the DayTrader application infrastructure to test specific
                    Java EE components such as the servlet engine, JSP support, EJB Entity, Session and Message Driven beans,
                    HTTP Session support and more.</p>
                <p>Additional overview information is included in the <a href="docs/tradeFAQ.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
